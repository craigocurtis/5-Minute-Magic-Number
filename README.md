# 5-Minute-Magic-Number
A Quick Random Number Generator

I'm a coding noob. I studied Chinese half of my life, live in China, 
and find it to be a waste of half my life. I was lucky enough to meet 
a good friend, Mark Powers, who opened my eyes to being able to create something that is perpetual.

So for my teaching job, I was asked if I had a random number picker.
With the basic jQuery I've picked up, I threw this together in 5 minutes for our presentation!
